/**
 * An interface for implementing classes that deal with report variables. This interface defines constants for names of
 * built-in variables and for reset, increment and calculation types.
 * <p>
 * When declaring a report group, the engine will automatically create a count variable that will calculate
 * the number of records that make up the current group (number of records processed between group ruptures).
 * The name for this variable comes from the name of the group it corresponds to, suffixed with the
 * "_COUNT" sequence. It can be used like any other report variable, in any report expression (even in the
 * current group expression like you can see done in the "BreakGroup" of the <i>jasper</i> sample).
