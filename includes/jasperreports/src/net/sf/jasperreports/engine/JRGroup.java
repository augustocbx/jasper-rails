/**
 * Groups represent a flexible way to organize data on a report. A report group is represented by sequence
 * of consecutive records in the data source that have something in common, like the value of a certain report
 * field for example.
 * <p>
 * The value of the associated group expression is what makes group records stick together. This value is the
 * thing that they have in common.
