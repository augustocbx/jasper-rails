/**
 * An abstract representation of a report elements container.
 * <p>
 * A frame is a report element that contains sub elements.
 * It has a backgroud, a border and it stretches to accommodate its content.
 * <p>
 * For the Graphics2D and PDF exporters, a frame is equivalent to a rectangle
 * placed behind a group of elements.  The HTML exporter creates sub-tables for frames
 * and the XLS exporter includes the frame sub elements into the grid.
 * <p>
 * For elements inside a frame, the coordinates, positionType and stretchType
 * properties are relative to the frame instead of the band.
